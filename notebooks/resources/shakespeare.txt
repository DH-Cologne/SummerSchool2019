Hold me, like the river Jordan
And I will then say to thee
You are my friend
Carry me, like you were my brother
Love me like a mother
Will you be thereâ€¦
Weary, tell me will you hold me
When wrong, will you scold me
When lost will you find me?
But they told me a man should be faithful
And walk when not able
And fight till the end but I'm only human (instru.)

Everyone taking control of me
Seems that the world's
Got a role for me I'm so confused
Will you show to me you'll be there for me
And care enough to bear me
(Hold me) (lay your head lowly)
(Softly then boldly) (carry me there)
(Hold me) (love me and feed me)
(Kiss me and free me) (I will be there)
(Carry) (carry me boldly) (lift me up slowly)
(Carry me there) (save me) (heal me and bathe me)
(Softly you say to me) (I will be there)
(Lift me) (lift me up slowly)
(Carry me bodly) (show me you care)
(Hold me) (lay your head lowly)
(Softly then boldly) (carry me there)
(Need me) (love me and feed me)
(Kiss me and free me) (I will be there)

Spoken : in our darkest hour in my deepest despair
Will you still care? Will you be there?
In my trials and my tribulations
Through our doubts and frustrations
In my violence ln my turbulence
Through my fear and my confessions
In my anguish and my pain
Through my joy and my sorrow
In the promise of another tomorrow
I'll never let you part for you're always in my heart
I'm Gonna Make A Change,
For Once In My Life
It's Gonna Feel Real Good,
Gonna Make A Difference
Gonna Make It Right . . .

As I, Turn Up The Collar On My
Favourite Winter Coat
This Wind Is Blowin' My Mind
I See The Kids In The Street,
With Not Enough To Eat
Who Am I, To Be Blind?
Pretending Not To See
Their Needs
A Summer's Disregard,
A Broken Bottle Top
And A One Man's Soul
They Follow Each Other On
The Wind Ya' Know
'Cause They Got Nowhere
To Go
That's Why I Want You To
Know

I've Been A Victim Of A Selfish
Kind Of Love
It's Time That I Realize
That There Are Some With No
Home, Not A Nickel To Loan
Could It Be Really Me,
Pretending That They're Not
Alone?

A Willow Deeply Scarred,
Somebody's Broken Heart
And A Washed-Out Dream
(Washed-Out Dream)
They Follow The Pattern Of
The Wind, Ya' See
Cause They Got No Place
To Be
That's Why I'm Starting With
Me

The Mirror

Heart)

[1st Verse]
She Was More Like A Beauty Queen From A Movie Scene
I Said Don't Mind, But What Do You Mean I Am The One
Who Will Dance On The Floor In The Round
She Said I Am The One Who Will Dance On The Floor In The Round

[2nd Verse]
She Told Me Her Name Was Billie Jean, As She Caused A Scene
Then Every Head Turned With Eyes That Dreamed Of Being The One
Who Will Dance On The Floor In The Round

[Bridge]
People Always Told Me Be Careful Of What You Do
And Don't Go Around Breaking Young Girls' Hearts

And Mother Always Told Me Be Careful Of Who You Love
And Be Careful Of What You Do 'Cause The Lie Becomes The Truth

[Chorus]
Billie Jean Is Not My Lover
She's Just A Girl Who Claims That I Am The One
But The Kid Is Not My Son
She Says I Am The One, But The Kid Is Not My Son

[3rd Verse]
For Forty Days And Forty Nights
The Law Was On Her Side
But Who Can Stand When She's In Demand
Her Schemes And Plans
'Cause We Danced On The Floor In The Round
So Take My Strong Advice, Just Remember To Always Think Twice
(Do Think Twice)

[4th Verse]
She Told My Baby That's A Threat
As She Looked At Me
Then Showed A Photo Of A Baby Cries
Eyes Would Like Mine
Go On Dance On The Floor In The Round, Baby

[Bridge]
People Always Told Me Be Careful Of What You Do
And Don't Go Around Breaking Young Girls' Hearts
She Came And Stood Right By Me
Then The Smell Of Sweet Perfume
This Happened Much Too Soon
She Called Me To Her Room

[Chorus]
Billie Jean Is Not My Lover
She's Just A Girl Who Claims That I Am The One
But The Kid Is Not My Son
Billie Jean Is Not My Lover
She's Just A Girl Who Claims That I Am The One
But The Kid Is Not My Son
She Says I Am The One, But The Kid Is Not My Son
She Says I Am The One, But The Kid Is Not My Son
Billie Jean Is Not My Lover
She's Just A Girl Who Claims That I Am The One
But The Kid Is Not My Son
She Says I Am The One, But The Kid Is Not My Son
She Says I Am The One, She Says He Is My Son
She Says I Am The One
Billie Jean Is Not My Lover
Billie Jean Is Not My Lover
Billie Jean Is Not My Lover
Billie Jean Is Not My Lover
Billie Jean Is Not My Lover
Billie Jean Is Not My Lover
Another day has gone
I'm still all alone
How could this be
You're not here with me
You never said goodbye
Someone tell me why
Did you have to go
And leave my world so cold

Everyday I sit and ask myself
How did love slip away
Something whispers in my ear and says
That you are not alone
For I am here with you
Though you're far away
I am here to stay

But you are not alone
For I am here with you
Though we're far apart
You're always in my heart
But you are not alone

'Lone, 'lone
Why, 'lone

Just the other night
I thought I heard you cry
Asking me to come
And hold you in my arms
I can hear your prayers
Your burdens I will bear
But first I need your hand
Then forever can begin

Everyday I sit and ask myself
How did love slip away
Something whispers in my ear and says
That you are not alone
For I am here with you
Though you're far away
I am here to stay

For you are not alone
For I am here with you
Though we're far apart
You're always in my heart
For you are not alone

Whisper three words and I'll come runnin'
And girl you know that I'll be there
I'll be there

You are not alone
For I am here with you
Though you're far away
I am here to stay
For you are not alone
For I am here with you
Though we're far apart
You're always in my heart

For you are not alone
For I am here with you
Though you're far away
I am here to stay

For you are not alone
For I am here with you
Though we're far apart
You're always in my heart

For you are not alone...
Skin head, dead head
Everybody gone bad
Situation, aggravation
Everybody allegation
In the suite, on the news
Everybody dog food
Bang bang, shot dead
Everybody's gone mad

All I wanna say is that
They don't really care about us
All I wanna say is that
They don't really care about us

Beat me, hate me
You can never break me
Will me, thrill me
You can never kill me
Jew me, sue me
Everybody do me
Kick me, kike me
Don't you black or white me

All I wanna say is that
They don't really care about us
All I wanna say is that
They don't really care about us

Tell me what has become of my life
I have a wife and two children who love me
I am the victim of police brutality, now
I'm tired of bein' the victim of hate
You're rapin' me off my pride
Oh, for God's sake
I look to heaven to fulfill its prophecy...
Set me free

Skin head, dead head
Everybody gone bad
Trepidation, speculation
Everybody allegation
In the suite, on the news
Everybody dog food
Black male, black mail
Throw your brother in jail

All I wanna say is that
They don't really care about us
All I wanna say is that
They don't really care about us

Tell me what has become of my rights
Am I invisible because you ignore me?
Your proclamation promised me free liberty, now
I'm tired of bein' the victim of shame
They're throwing me in a class with a bad name
I can't believe this is the land from which I came
You know I really do hate to say it
The government don't wanna see
But if Roosevelt was livin'
He wouldn't let this be, no, no

Skin head, dead head
Everybody gone bad
Situation, speculation
Everybody litigation
Beat me, bash me
You can never trash me
Hit me, kick me
You can never get me

All I wanna say is that
They don't really care about us
All I wanna say is that
They don't really care about us

Some things in life they just don't wanna see
But if Martin Luther was livin'
He wouldn't let this be, no, no

Skin head, dead head
Everybody gone bad
Situation, segregation
Everybody allegation
In the suite, on the news
Everybody dog food
Kick me, kike me
Don't you wrong or right me

All I wanna say is that
They don't really care about us
All I wanna say is that
They don't really care about us

All I wanna say is that
They don't really care about us
All I wanna say is that
They don't really care about
All I wanna say is that
they don't really care about
All I wanna say is that
They don't really care about us

No Mercy,
This is officially a Refugee Camp Remix,
Home with it.

I'm right back where I wanna be,
Told me that you're doin' wrong, (oh my, zippin' through)
Word out shockin' all alone (no)
Cryin' wolf ain't like a man
Throwin' rocks to hide your hand (yeah hey)

You ain't done enough for me
You ain't done enough for me
You are disgustin' me
(Yeah, yeah)
You're aiming just for me
You are disgustin' me
Just want your cut from me
But too bad, too bad

Ah, look who just walked in the place (refugee camp)
Dead and stuffy in the face (yeah yeah yeah yeah)
Look who's standing if you please (yeah yeah yeah)
No, though you tried to bring me to my knees

Too bad, too bad about it
Why don't you scream and shout it
Too bad, too bad about it
Why don't you just scream and shout it
Too bad, too bad about it
Why don't you scream and shout it
Too bad, too bad about it
Why don't you just scream and shout it

You say jump forte
Like the major holiday,
I met with MJ on the ranch of seven fey,
Flowin' to them g six, that's how you saw them remix,
Blast off a cramp while I laugh at yo re-six,
T double O B A to the D,
You just double A,
Small town battery,
Buffet,
You can't eat of them floor we bend,
Word like the power lunch of the four seasons,
Too bad.

What do you want from me
What do you want from me

Tired of you haunting me
(Yeah, yeah)
You're aiming just for me
You are disgustin' me
You got blood lust for me
But too bad, too bad

Look who got slapped in the face (refugee camp),
It's dead and stuffy in the place (get the cash)
Right back where I wanna be
I'm standin' though you're kickin' me

Too bad, too bad about it
Why don't you scream and shout it
Too bad, too bad about it
Why don't you just scream and shout it
Too bad, too bad about it

Just enough to make your juices flow
Press play, don't stop, rotate, too hot
You feel I'm real
I'm everything you need, so tell me what's the deal

[CHORUS]
2000 Watts, 8 ohms, 200 volts, real strong
Too much of that, fuse blown
Be careful what you say don't overload

Too much of that, fuse blown
Be careful what you say don't overload

Compact steelo, chico, D-Lo, highpost lady
Shorty really wanna be there for me

[AD LIBS]

[CHORUS OUT]
Twenty-five miles from home, girl
My feet are hurtin? mighty bad
Now I've been walkin? for three days
And two lonely nights
You know that I'm mighty bad
But I got a girl waitin? for me
That's gonna make this trip worthwhile
You see, she's got the kind
Of lovin? and kissin?
Make a boy go stone wild

I got to keep on walkin?
Oh I got to walk on
Let me tell you, y'all
I'm so tired
But I just can't lose my stride

I got fifteen miles to go now
And I can hear my baby callin? my name
It's as if, as though
I'm standin? at her front door
And I can hear that doggone thing
Now I'll be so glad to see my baby
And hold her in my arms one more time
And when I kiss her lips
I turn backward flip
And I forget about these feet of mine

I got to keep on walkin?
Oh I got to walk on
Let me tell you, y'all
I'm so tired
But I just can't lose my stride

Yeah I got to walk on
Let me tell you, y'all
Hope my feet don't fail me now
I got five more miles to go
I got nine, eight, seven
Six, oh six

I got five more miles to go now
Over the hills just around the bend
Although my feet are tired
I can't lose my stride
I got to get my baby back again

I got to keep on walkin?
I got to walk on
Let me tell y'all
I'm so tired now
But I just can't lose my stride
Oh, I got to walk on
Let me tell you now
I'm so tired
But I just can't lose my stride
I got to walk on
Everybody look around-
'Cause there's a reason to rejoice

Everybody look up-
And feel the hope

And dread is gone...

It's such a change
For us to live so independently-

As I drove across on the highway
My jeep began to rock
I didn't know what to do so I stopped and got out
And looked down and noticed I got a flat

So I walked out, parked the car like sideways
So I can find what I can fix
I looked around there were no cars on the highway
I felt a strange feeling like a mist

I walked down towards the end of the road
And in the fog a woman appeared
She said don't you worry my friend I'll take care
Take my hand, I'll take you there

Oh
Take me to a place without no name
Take me to a place without no name
Take me to a place without no name
Take me to a place without no name

As she took me right through the fog
I see a beautiful city appear
Where kids are playin' and people are laughin' and smiling and
Nothing to fear fear

She said this is the place where no people have pain
With love and happiness
She turned around looked down at my eyes and started cryin'
She grabbed my hand, you got a friend

Oh
Take me to a place without no name
Yeah

She started likin' me kissin' me and huggin' me
She didn't really, really want me to leave
She showed me places I've never seen things I've never done
This really looks like a lotta fun

I seen the grass and the sky and the birds
And the flowers surrounded by the trees
This place is filled with love and happiness
How in the world could I wanna leave

So then I went in my pocket took my wallet on out
With my pictures of my family and girl
This is the place that you choose to be with me
When you thought you could be in another world

Oh
Take me to a place without no name
La la la
A place without no name
La la la

A place without no name (La, la, la)

Spoken Intro :
You ever want something
that you know you shouldn't have
The more you know you shouldn't have it,
The more you want it
And then one day you get it,
It's so good too
But it's just like my girl
When she's around me
I just feel so good, so good
But right now I just feel cold, so cold
Right down to my bones
'Cause ooh...
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
It's not warm when she's away
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
And she's always gone too long
Anytime she goes away

Wonder this time where she's gone
Wonder if she's gone to stay
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
And this house just ain't no home
Anytime she goes away

I know, I know, I know, I know,
I know, know, know, know, know,
I know, I know,
Hey I ought to leave
I ought to leave her alone
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone

Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
Only darkness every day
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
And this house just ain't no home
Anytime she goes away
Why did you let him get away
After the staring what did you say
You shot me down as cold as ice
Staring my face ill hold you tight

Why did you let him get away
After the staring what did you say
You shot me down as cold as ice
Staring my face ill hold you tight

Too Bad
Forget it cus
its Al Capone thats in
it
Too Sad
Regret it cus
a mad man is out tonight

Should have told nobody ever showed her but us
The Girl was griefing nobody should be griefing this way.

Why did you let him get away
After the staring what did you say
You shot me down as cold as ice
Staring my face ill hold you tight
Why did you let him get away
After the staring what did you say
You shot me down as cold as ice
Staring my face ill hold you tight

Too Bad
Forget it cus
its Al Capone thats in it
Too Sad
Regret It cus
I told her out tonight

Should have told her nobody ever showed her but us
The girl was griefing nobody should be griefing this way

oow!!!
(Chorus and first verse continuis)
You are the promised kiss of springtime
That makes the lonely winter seem long
You are the breathless hush of evening
That trembles on the brink of a lovely song

You are the angel glow that lights a star
The dearest things I know are what you are

Some day my happy arms will hold you
And some day I'll know that moment divine
When all the things you are, are mine

You are the angel glow that lights a star
The dearest things I know are what you are

Some day my happy arms will hold you
And some day I'll know that moment divine
When all the things you are, are mine
