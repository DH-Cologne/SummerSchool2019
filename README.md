## SummerSchool2019

The software requirement for this repository is Docker. Docker is a tool to create isolated environments for applications, called container. Docker exists for all common OS, including Linux, MacOS and Windows. You can find multiple installation guides on the web, e.g.: 

    Windows: https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/
    MacOS: https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/
    Ubuntu: https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/
    More guides can be found here: https://docs.docker.com/install/

To run the docker container we have different scenarios for different operating systems:

### Windows 10 Pro and Edu

take the link with the ip that appears in the cmd and enter it with your browser


### MacOS
open terminal → navigate to this folder (SummerSchool2019) and call run.sh<br>
take the link with the ip that appears in the cmd and enter it with your browser

### Unbuntu

take the link with the ip that appears in the cmd and enter it with your browser

### Windows Home (Docker Toolbox)
